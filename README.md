## Overview

This project analyzes the climate over the last 20 years in the film industry. Descriptive analysis of film characteristics by film ROI shows that particular characteristics are common across the highest revenue films. Microsoft can use this analysis to determine the best direction for profitable product development and launch.

## Conclusions

This analysis leads to five recommendations for MS2021:

- **Produce films with a budget greater than 100mil** Films with the highest investments have the highest rate of return.
- **Pay attention to film MPAA rating** Films with the highest investments have the highest rate of return.
- **Work within the most popular genres.** Films with the highest investments have the highest rate of return.
- **Hire highly rated directors** Films with the highest investments have the highest rate of return.
- **Make films that run between 90-130 minutes.** Films outside of this range drop drastically in performance.
- **Release the film on a Friday, ideally in the months of March-April or October-December** ROI is highest during these periods, regardless of genre.

### Next Steps

Further analyses could yield additional insights and improve understanding of the industry:

- **Analyze the effect of streaming services on box office releases** This modeling could use already available data, such as breed and intake condition.
- **Explore relationship between physical location and film performance**
